*** App Brainstorming ***
Apps that I find interesting to use:
- Amazon:
    - See the suggested lists
    - Add to basket
    - View the images
    - View the review
    - Delete items
    - Add to wish list
    - Categorize products
    - Choose delivery option
    - Track package

- Shopee:
    - Option to add to basket, buy products is similar to Amazon
    - Livestream option and buy goods directly in that livestream
    - Any users can go on and sell goods, or buy goods, do not have to switch account for different purposes
    - Rank user: Higher rank means more access to good deals and promo code
    - Can partner with local restaurants to deliver food and beverages as well

- Instagram:
    - Can upload images
    - Can add comments and reactions
    - Can have direct messages
    - Can partner with some brands to promote products

- Tiktok:
    - Can have livestream option to sell products and buy products directly in the livestream
    - Can upload short videos
    - Can see the list of following account and  not following account on different tabs

App idea:

As for the features in my favaroite apps above, I want to create an app that users can take advantage of it as a social media app or an ecommerce app. 
In more detail, here are my proposed ideas:
    - Users can sign in to their account to post pictures/videos
    - They can link the product they are using inside their post and it will redirect other viewers to the page selling them when they click on that product link
    - They can create livestream session, where they can take advantage of their influence on social media to sell products or promote products and viewers can buy the products directly in that livestream
    - One account can be both seller and buyer, do not need to switch
    - Can send direct messages to other for casual chatting
    - Can react and comment on other posts

With those proposed ideas, I believe my app will be beneficial for users because now their social media and ecommerce apps are combined within 1 app.
